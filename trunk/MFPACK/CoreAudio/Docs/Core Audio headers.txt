MFPack - Core Audio headers


Headers and libraries that define all of the Core Audio APIs.

The Core Audio APIs are:
 - Multimedia Device (MMDevice) API: 
   Clients use this API to enumerate the audio endpoint devices in the system.
 - Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI):
   Clients use this API to create and manage audio streams to and from audio endpoint devices.
 - DeviceTopology API:
   Clients use this API to directly access the topological features (for example, volume controls and multiplexers) that 
   lie along the data paths inside hardware devices in audio adapters.
 - EndpointVolume API. Clients use this API to directly access the volume controls on audio endpoint devices. 
   This API is primarily used by applications that manage exclusive-mode audio streams.



To find the header and library for a specific API element,
please consult the reference pages in the Core Audio Programming Reference on 
MSDN (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370851)

LIBRARIES
//Todo


REMARKS: -


Every Delphi unit has a section that contains helpers specific for the Delphi programming language.
If, however, a helper or utility covers more units, then this will be added in a Delphi helper unit located in /Common
