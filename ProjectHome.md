# Welcome to the Delphi/Free Pascal MFPack Media Foundation project. #

_The goal of the project is to provide: Header Conversions, Samples, Components etc. for the Microsoft Windows Multi Media platforms, equal or higher than Windows Vista (Windows XP on some occasions)_

The project follows along the lines of the Microsoft protocol of programming and API-structure.
See the Wiki pages for details (if published).








**Notes:**

Due to changed policy of the Free Delphi/Pascal translators, we decided to change some rules:
  * The translation format specifications, terms and conditions as noted by Borland, CodeGear and Embarcadero published on http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/10281 are from now on rejected by us, to protect our sources against commercial (ab)use.
  * C++ Builder directives are or will be abandoned from the sources.
  * Supplement to the Licence: All kinds of commercial use, including distribution of any kind, of the sources are strictly forbidden, unless you have a written permission/agreement with the copyright and author-right holders.
  * Translations, structures, routines, naming and models are following the Microsoft protocols. For you it will be an improvement, while studying the MSDN documentations.
