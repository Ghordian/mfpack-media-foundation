= The Header Translation Style =

The translated headers are as close to the original headers, unless there is no possible way to insert or to alter.
These translations differ from the earlier translation styles in a way that Delphi pointers and types, as well C++ Builder compiler directives are no longer supported.
 
Translated headers have the following structure:

  *  Header, containing information about origin, project, copyrights, license etc.
  *  Unit: Name of the unit. The unitname is capitalized but has the the same name as the original header (.h) file.
  *  Interface
  *  Uses clause
  *  Blocks(s) of pre-defined constants, types etc.
  *  Type block with forwarded interface declarations followed by the Interfaces themselves.
  *  Additional block: Here all helpers and Delphi specific additions are placed (in between the comment blocks "//Additional Prototypes for ALL interfaces" and "//End of Additional Prototypes". So, here the translations might differ from the official Microsoft implementations.
  *  implementation: All functions, classes etc. defined (if needed) from the earlier blocks.
