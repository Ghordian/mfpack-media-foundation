_MFPack is using the name *Media Foundation*, to cover all platforms related to Multimedia for the Windows Operating System (OS)._

Here the overview list MFPack will cover:
  *  *Core Audio APIs* : A low-level API for audio capture and audio rendering, which can be used to achieve minimum latency or to implement features that might not be entirely supported by higher-level media APIs.
  *  *Microsoft Media Foundation* : An end-to-end media pipeline, which supports playback, audio/video capture, and encoding (successor to DirectShow).
  *  *Windows Media Library Sharing Services* : Enables applications to discover media devices on the home network, and share media libraries on the home network and the Internet.
