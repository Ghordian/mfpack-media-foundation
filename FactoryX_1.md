# About FactoryX #

## Introduction ##

FactoryX is originated from the late 80's as a developer/composer of sound (midi, Tracker etc.) Later on in the beginning 90's it joined the community of software "testers" to check vulnerabilities. After this short episode FacoryX rejoined the music scene and related hardware/software development. Until the end of the 90's FactoryX moved to develop audio and video software until 2002. Yet FactoryX is still a life and kicking with a new goal: Translating and developing the next generation of interfaces based on the new media technologies from Microsoft for their OS Windows 7 to start with.
